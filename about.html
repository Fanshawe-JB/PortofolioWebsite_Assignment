                        I honestly prefer to keep learning, continue to challenge myself do interesting and create cool projects that matter to me the most. At the same time I want to increase my knowledge and overcome any sort of weakness that I may have or occur. I want to be the best I can be. My over the top energy fuels my interest, hobbies, different kind of areas of study and number of artistic experience. 
                        <br><br>
                        I learn slow at first but will take me time learn but when I do reptively then I able to pick up new skills faster and juggle them around different projects and roles with relative ease. I'm constantly learning, advancing and upgraing my toolbox of languages. I am fluently in HTML and CSS but trying to overcome my diffculties in JavaScript. Although, I do have knowledge with MySQL, PHP, React, React-Native, Node.js, Swift, Tailwind, Vue and Sass. 
                        <br><br>
                        I can usually be found downing coffee, wandering around different kind of area like the park, mall, resturants and etc. I like to amuse people by cracking some jokes and making them laugh or planning my next great adventure. Rarely at the same time, that would be impressive. 
                        <br><br>
                        My hobbies are spending time with my family and friends which I enjoy as well as I find that very important to me. I like to be around them. I love to read depending what I am reading and depending on my taste if it interests me. I love to connect with people, work on different kind projects where I adapt new skills from them and learn new things at the same time. I like code, learn new programming languages and same thing that goes for designing. Love to create new kinds of music and sing to favorite songs. I like to be close to my religion and pray as much as I can. I enjoy try new type of foods from aroudn the world especially love to travel. Hope to explore different places one day. I love to go on long drive or long walks and explore the beauty of mother nature. My major thing that I like to do is sleep all day long and I hate being interuppted when I am sleepingThese are some few things about me.
